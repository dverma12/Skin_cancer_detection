# Melonoma Detection
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma ( a type of skin cancer)

## Problem Statetment
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

### Steps for Model Building

1. Data Reading/Data Understanding

2. Data Creation

3. Dataset visualisation

4. Model Building & training

5. Data augmentation strategy to resolve underfitting/overfitting 

6. Model Building & training on the augmented data

7. Class Distribution

8. Handling class imbalances

9. Model Building & training on the rectified class imbalance data
